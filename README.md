# item-tracker

This is a full stack project.   
You can track transactional data in this app -  create, delete and update items.  
The data is stored in a relational database, the layout is dynamic, you can filter and order by columns.

### Technology I  used:  
<ul>
<li>Django</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ul>  
  
### Real-world application
The app can be used for any team that needs to track transactional requests.  
It can be an alternative for Excel files. The relational database is much more stable and gives further opportunities, the whole process is more customizable and the roles are more separable.  
In the other hand, this app is faster than an Excel Online.

<li>Export and Import as csv/xlsx</li>
</ul>
